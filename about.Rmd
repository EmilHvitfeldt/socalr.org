We are an alliance of R users groups in Southern California R Users. No single group can serve this sprawling area, and so we have joined forces to centralize all R group events and information in one place. We currently include `r glue::glue_collapse(laocrugs$group_name, sep = ", ", last = ", and ")`.

If you are a new R organization in the area and would like to join, please [contact us](mailto:larusers@gmail.com).

You can find the source code for this website, which was written in R, on [GitHub](https://github.com/laRusers/laocrug).
