We are an alliance of R users groups in Los Angeles and Orange County. No single group can serve this sprawling area, and so we have joined forces to centralize all R group events and information in one place. We currently include `r glue::glue_collapse(laocrugs$group_name, sep = ", ", last = ", and ")`.
